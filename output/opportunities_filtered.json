Please limit information entered in this column to 100 characters. To the extent that narrative information is provided, Offerors may use the Technical Capability Narrative to provide narrative explanation of the TCPs - note that the page limit for the Technical Capability Narrative has been increased to twelve (12) pages.&rdquo; We would like to know if 100 characters is the limit for each support document or the total for each cell in the spreadsheet. Some of our TCPs will list multiple documents so we would like clarification on this limitation.</p>\\n\\n<p class=\\\"sam-rich-text-editor-indent-b\\\"><strong>Answer #104:</strong> Offerors should limit their entries in the Attachment 3 reference column to 100 characters for each support document referenced. Note that this is a recommendation, but not a firm requirement (e.g., &quot;Please limit&quot; vice &quot;Offerors must limit&quot;), intended to ensure information entered into Attachment 3 is provided to direct evaluators towards the applicable substantiating information, but not to provide additional explanation and/or narrative information to bypass the applicable page limits for the Technical Capability Narrative.

For A&amp;E projects with an estimated total fee under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (currently $350,000) agencies may review current data files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the three (3) most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the three (3) firms to determine the best qualified firm for that project. A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second-best qualified firm, and so on. AE data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE&#39;s ability to provide licensed professionals in the State/Territory where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm&#39;s geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE&#39;s SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exists.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Large Businesses should not respond.</strong> All acquisitions utilizing this short selection database shall be set aside for small business concerns.

At that point, the submittal package for those specific firms will be pulled from the file and used to perform a technical review as described in the synopsis.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>The company submittal shall include the following information:</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li><strong>Cover letter</strong> should be included with all other data.

The solicitation will be issued electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov .   Proposal documents will be available for download in Microsoft Word, HTML, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe PDF; Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format; and drawings will be available in PDF format.   Please Note:  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  <br/><br/>Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.  The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List and a Watchlist where you can add your company's interest. Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Interested vendors and plan holders are required to visit the website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the synopsis or solicitation documents. <br/><br/>Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with the DOI are required to have an active registration in the Systems for Awards Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov to include an active Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) with an all awards designation in order to conduct business with the Federal Government. <br/><br/>This pre-solicitation announcement is not a solicitation document, but pre-notice of an upcoming solicitation. Specific instructions on submitting your proposal will be contained in the solicitation documents to be issued on or after the date listed below. <br/><br/>Proposed Solicitation Issue Date:  Estimated on/about February 16, 2026.  <br/><br/>This is currently an unfunded requirement with a high expectation that funds will be available. When and if funds become available a contract will be awarded at that time.<br/>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330 with a size standard of $25.5 million.<br/><br/>Title of Project:  Architect-Engineer (A/E) Fire Protection Engineering and supporting services<br/>Description:  <br/><br/>The National Park Service (NPS), Washington Contracting Office (WCO), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado, 80225, is seeking qualified Small Business firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Architect-Engineer (A/E) Fire Protection Engineering and supporting services under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units either on-site at various DOI locations throughout the United States, its territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the District of Columbia or off-site at the Contractor's facility.<br/>Work performed under an IDIQ as contemplated in this Request for Qualifications must be performed by individuals licensed or certified in at least one state or protectorate. It is difficult to anticipate ahead of time which disciplines NPS may require services to be performed under any given task order. Therefore firms, either on their own or in combination with subcontractors, provided compliance with the limitation on subcontracting is met, must have or be eligible to acquire professional qualifications, including license in various DOI locations throughout the United States, its territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the District of Columbia as necessary for the completion of a task order within 30 days of being notified of most highly qualified status. This restriction is necessary to meet licensure and certification requirements as well as to avoid undue delay in meeting agency requirements as they arise while taking into consideration concerns for human health and safety. As such, firms must demonstrate that they are or are capable of being or are eligible to be licensed or certified in any of the required disciplines within 30 days of being notified of most highly qualified status.<br/>Type of Procurement:  It is anticipated that two (2) negotiated firm-fixed price IDIQ contracts will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal.  The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.  <br/><br/>Estimated Price Range:  $5 million each contract<br/><br/>Estimated Period of Performance:  April 1, 2026, through March 31, 2031<br/><br/>Proposal receipt date is not known at this time.  The actual date will be established in the solicitation documents<br/><br/>This procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  Responsible small business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The small business size standard for NAICS 541330 is $25.5 million.  Small Disadvantaged Business and HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clause, FAR 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns.<br/>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered.  It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.  Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov . <br/><br/>No responses required as this is just a pre-solicitation announcement\"}",
