NIWC Pacific, as the principle Navy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) and Acquisition Center for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Information Operations (IO) is responsible for functions that include: mission analysis, assessment and development of technology base, basic and applied research, demonstration of technology, engineering in support of production, support to operating forces; supporting doctrine, policy, and strategy development; and integration of numerous National and Tactical systems in the area of Cyberspace Operations. To meet these responsibilities, NIWC Pacific requires advice, assistance, coordination and products necessary to support operational planning, assessment, integration, execution and technology development to assure superiority for the warfighter in the cyberspace domain. The full scope of this requirement is anticipated to include: technology assessment, development and transition; systems engineering; operational and technical support; exercise and experimentation support; software development and prototyping; training support; security engineering/cybersecurity. This is a follow-on requirement to a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) of the same title: Cyberspace Science, Research, Engineering and Technology Integration. A Small Business Set-Aside Cyberspace Science, Research, Engineering and Technology MAC (SBSA MAC) that covered a portion of the requirement was competed among small businesses was only awarded in 2017. The incumbent contract numbers for the Small Business MAC are N66001-17-D-0114 through -0117 and the incumbent contractors are Avanti Technologies Inc., Millennium Corporation, Sentar Inc., and Vector Planning and Services Inc. The ordering period of the predecessor SBSA MAC ended 07 March 2022. This follow-on procurement will be satisfied through one solicitation (which is the subject of this pre-solicitation notice) that will be competed among small businesses only. N66001-26-R-0002 is strictly a follow-on for the Small Business MAC. The full scope of the requirement is described in the attached Draft SOW. Only small businesses can compete for the SBSA multiple award contract (MAC). The follow-on for the SBSA MAC will be solicited at a future date estimated in Q2 2026. NIWC Pacific does not intend to hold an industry day for this requirement. This proposed acquisition has security requirements at the Top Secret level with incidental Secure Compartmented Information (SCI) access. NIWC Pacific intends on awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contracts. The prospective contracts will have a five-year base period with a two-year period. The estimated level of effort for the total SBSA requirement is 305,981 hours. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 with a size standard of $47 million. A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided.

The solicitation will be issued electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov .   Proposal documents will be available for download in Microsoft Word, HTML, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe PDF; Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format; and drawings will be available in PDF format.   Please Note:  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  <br/><br/>Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.  The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List and a Watchlist where you can add your company's interest. Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Interested vendors and plan holders are required to visit the website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the synopsis or solicitation documents. <br/><br/>Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with the DOI are required to have an active registration in the Systems for Awards Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov to include an active Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) with an all awards designation in order to conduct business with the Federal Government. <br/><br/>This pre-solicitation announcement is not a solicitation document, but pre-notice of an upcoming solicitation. Specific instructions on submitting your proposal will be contained in the solicitation documents to be issued on or after the date listed below. <br/><br/>Proposed Solicitation Issue Date:  Estimated on/about February 16, 2026.  <br/><br/>This is currently an unfunded requirement with a high expectation that funds will be available. When and if funds become available a contract will be awarded at that time.<br/>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330 with a size standard of $25.5 million.<br/><br/>Title of Project:  Architect-Engineer (A/E) Fire Protection Engineering and supporting services<br/>Description:  <br/><br/>The National Park Service (NPS), Washington Contracting Office (WCO), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado, 80225, is seeking qualified Small Business firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Architect-Engineer (A/E) Fire Protection Engineering and supporting services under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units either on-site at various DOI locations throughout the United States, its territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the District of Columbia or off-site at the Contractor's facility.<br/>Work performed under an IDIQ as contemplated in this Request for Qualifications must be performed by individuals licensed or certified in at least one state or protectorate. It is difficult to anticipate ahead of time which disciplines NPS may require services to be performed under any given task order. Therefore firms, either on their own or in combination with subcontractors, provided compliance with the limitation on subcontracting is met, must have or be eligible to acquire professional qualifications, including license in various DOI locations throughout the United States, its territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the District of Columbia as necessary for the completion of a task order within 30 days of being notified of most highly qualified status. This restriction is necessary to meet licensure and certification requirements as well as to avoid undue delay in meeting agency requirements as they arise while taking into consideration concerns for human health and safety. As such, firms must demonstrate that they are or are capable of being or are eligible to be licensed or certified in any of the required disciplines within 30 days of being notified of most highly qualified status.<br/>Type of Procurement:  It is anticipated that two (2) negotiated firm-fixed price IDIQ contracts will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal.  The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.  <br/><br/>Estimated Price Range:  $5 million each contract<br/><br/>Estimated Period of Performance:  April 1, 2026, through March 31, 2031<br/><br/>Proposal receipt date is not known at this time.  The actual date will be established in the solicitation documents<br/><br/>This procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  Responsible small business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The small business size standard for NAICS 541330 is $25.5 million.  Small Disadvantaged Business and HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clause, FAR 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns.<br/>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered.  It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.  Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov . <br/><br/>No responses required as this is just a pre-solicitation announcement\"}",

For A&amp;E projects with an estimated total fee under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (currently $350,000) agencies may review current data files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the three (3) most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the three (3) firms to determine the best qualified firm for that project. A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second-best qualified firm, and so on. AE data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE&#39;s ability to provide licensed professionals in the State/Territory where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm&#39;s geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE&#39;s SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exists.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Large Businesses should not respond.</strong> All acquisitions utilizing this short selection database shall be set aside for small business concerns. The database is set up with filters for State, Zip Code, NAICS Codes, Small Business Size, and Small Business Socio-Economic Classification.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Existing Small Business Firms and New Submittals</strong>.&nbsp; The SRS shortlist is maintained on a three-year cycle. &nbsp;A base year consisting of the SF330 submittal and two subsequent years that only require a recertification.&nbsp; SF330s are valid for a period of three years and can be updated should significant company changes occur.</p>\\n\\n<p>- Existing Firms on 2024-2026 Cycle: Your firm is not required to submit a new SF330 but should return the annual certification sent to you via email.&nbsp; You must have an active unique SAM.GOV registration to be considered for awards.</p>\\n\\n<p>- New Firms for 2024-2026 Cycle: Your firm is required to submit a complete SF330 and Attachment A for the year 2026.&nbsp; See below for details. &nbsp;You must have an active unique SAM.GOV registration to be considered for awards.</p>\\n\\n<p>- 2027.&nbsp; ALL Firms are required to submit a new SF330. &nbsp;&nbsp;This will begin a new 3-year cycle.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Submittals shall be brief and concise. <strong><u>Only the first fi</u></strong><strong><u>ft</u></strong><strong><u>y (50) pages</u></strong> of your response will be retained. The Initial review will determine if a firm is minimally qualified to do work for the Federal Government as described in the synopsis.&nbsp; After initial evaluation, minimally qualified firms will be listed in the short selection database and the first 50 pages of their submittal package placed on file.</p>\\n\\n<p>As specific projects arise, the short selection database will be used to pull a list of qualified firms that can perform the needed work at the specific location. At that point, the submittal package for those specific firms will be pulled from the file and used to perform a technical review as described in the synopsis.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>The company submittal shall include the following information:</em></strong></p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li><strong>Cover letter</strong> should be included with all other data. The letter should outline the work your firm specializes in and include a brief description of your firm&#39;s capabilities specifically relating to the project examples stated above. 1 Page Limit &ndash; <em>Not included in 50-page limit.</em></li>\\n\\t<li><strong>&nbsp;Attachment A - A&amp;E Submittal Cover Sheet</strong>.&nbsp; A-E FIRMS DO NOT NEED TO COVER ALL LOCATIONS NOR DO THEY NEED TO PERFORM ALL NAICS.
